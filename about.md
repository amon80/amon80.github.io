My name is **Marco**, I am a Software Engineer currently living and working in Tokyo, Japan.

Writing has always been an hobby of mine. Unfortunately I'm a hardcore pen and paper fan, so keeping a blog has always been difficult for me. Let's see if this time I can keep this blog around for more than 2 blog posts.

Some random bits about me:

- I'm big tennis fan since the advent of the big 4.
- I love to read. I'm co-host of a book club in Tokyo for international people.
- I became a Zen Buddhist since July 2024.
- I love every form of cooking, bakery in particular.
- I am currently studying Japanese with terrible results.
