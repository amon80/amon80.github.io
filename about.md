My name is **Marco Mecchia**, I am a Master Degree student at [University of Salerno, Computer Science Department](http://www.di.unisa.it/).

This personal blog has been ispired by my collegue [Andrea Solda](https://asolda.github.io/about/), who recently started one using [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo). I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) instead.

As a computer scientist, my research interests are **Advanced Algorythms**, **Social Networks Theory**, **Machine Learning** and **NeuroImaging**. I'm also a big tennis fan and I love every form of cooking, bakery in particular. Recently, I started a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcK9hLSbkKhlI1azGVPRtXQ) where I try to help people with video tutorials about recipies and wet shaving. Unfortunatly, those tutorials are only in italian for now :(.

You can find most of my works on my github page {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}.

You can email me at **lazlo93 the-at-symbol gmail the-dot-symbol com** using my [PGP Public Key]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/files/marco.gpg %}).

#### FAQS ####

#### Q: "Why is your email in such a strange format?" ####

A: "It's because so I can (hopefully!) avoid spam email."

#### Q: "Why should I use your public key to contact you? Can't I send you a normal email?" ####

A: "You could, but there are some reason you should avoid this:

1) You can't be sure your email won't be read by our providers.

2) You can't be sure an eventual reply will come from me.

Besides, encrypted emails aren't so hard to use! You can use []() in order to send encrypted mail within Mozilla Thunderbird. "

#### Q: "Will comments be available?" ####

A: "Sure, just let me figure out how Disqus integration works."
