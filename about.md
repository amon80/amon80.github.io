![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/pictures/picture.jpg)

My name is **Marco Mecchia**, I am a Software Engineer currently working in [Intel Ireland](https://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/company-overview/intel-leixlip.html). 

As a computer scientist, my interests are **Advanced Algorythms**, **Social Networks Theory**, **Machine Learning**, **NeuroImaging**, **Computer Vision** and **Embedded Systems**. I'm also a big tennis fan and I love every form of cooking, bakery in particular. 

Recently, I started a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcK9hLSbkKhlI1azGVPRtXQ) where I try to help people with video tutorials about recipies and wet shaving. Unfortunatly, those tutorials are only in italian for now :(.

You can find my resume (in english) [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/files/cv.pdf %}).

You can find most of my projects non related to work on my github page {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}.

You can email me at **lazlo93 the-at-symbol gmail the-dot-symbol com**.
