![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/pictures/picture.jpg)

My name is **Marco Mecchia**, I am a Software Engineer currently working in [Amazon Spain](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/location/madrid-spain). 

As a computer scientist, my interests are **Advanced Algorythms**, **Social Networks Theory**, **Machine Learning**, **NeuroImaging**, **Computer Vision** and **Embedded Systems**. Recently, I've recently started to work on **Service-based architectures**. I'm also a big tennis fan and I love every form of cooking, bakery in particular. 

I used to host my CV on this website, but recently I've become a bit paranoid about stalkers (with good reason). If for whatever reason you would like a copy of my CV, please email me at **lazlo93 the-at-symbol gmail the-dot-symbol com**.

You can find most of my projects non related to work on my github page {% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}.
