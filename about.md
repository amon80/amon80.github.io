My name is **Marco Mecchia**, I am a Software Engineer currently working in [Amazon Spain](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/location/madrid-spain). 

As a computer scientist, my interests are **Advanced Algorythms**, **Social Networks Theory**, **Machine Learning**, **NeuroImaging**, **Computer Vision** and **Embedded Systems**. Recently, I've recently started to work on **Service-based architectures**. I'm also a big tennis fan and I love every form of cooking, bakery in particular.
