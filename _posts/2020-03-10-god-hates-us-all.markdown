No, he doesn't. Or better, I don't really care. Religion has lost importance in my life since 2008, when I read an awesome book called ["The god delusion"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion) that persuaded me to stay away from it. I highly recommend it, whether you believe in god or not.

The title of this post follows a tradition that I started a long time ago: my diary entries usually have names of songs or movies, or sometimes even of famous quote contained in them. It started as a pure coincidence when a titled an entry "First rule of Fight club: Never talk about fight club.". I thought it was a good way to sumarize the difficulty I felt about expressing my feelings and opinions to other people. With time it became natural to think about a song or a movie or a quote that fits perfectly what I want to write. 

For whose of you who don't know, "God hates us all" is an album by Slayer. Unless you are an hardcore metal fun I don't recommend listening to it, as you might experience bleeding ears after the first two songs. If you want to try a glimps of it, I definetly suggest the song ["Disciple"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS0mQ25ezq4), that despite it's name acts as the title track of the album. At this point I'm supposed to say something along the line of "Drop a comment if you liked the song", but I'm not really sure anyone reads this blog.

So yeah, it looks like god is playing a game of [Plague Inc.](https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc) with us. People familiar with the game already know the solution to avoid the extinction of humankind: close docks and airports of Greenland. Maybe also Madagascar works. But in the meantime, what do we do in the other countries? How do we face it?

Well, one does not need to be an expert in virology to know the answer: stay home as much as possible, avoid to go out if it is not strictly necessary and for god sake just avoid any kind of social reunion! I still get goosebumps if I think about all the people that joined the [march on the International Women Day in Madrid some days ago](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-08/thousands-march-in-spain-on-womens-day-despite-coronavirus-fears). And don't let me get started about [Italians that are assaulting the supermarkets](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/coronavirus/video-2127286/Video-Queue-stretching-outside-supermarket-Italy-lockdown.html), doing totally the opposite of what they are supposed to do.

What? What do you do at home all the time? Is this a serious question? Work through smart working, read that book that you always wanted to read, watch that movie you never had time to watch, play that videogame you have always wanted to play. Or write a blog, like I'm doing! :D
