Life is strange. No, I'm not talking about the famous video game. I'm referring to the weird ways a person's story likes to unfold.

Take my case. I had a terrible experience with Soka Gakkai in Spain. And yet, I married a Soka Gakkai member in Japan. I must be a masochist or something, that's the only explanation. When my life gets too comfortable, I need to spice it up. Otherwise, where is the fun? Why play on easy when you can play on hard?

Needless to say, I was hoping that having a wife in Soka Gakkai would not interfere with my life too much. After all, we are in 2025, aren't we? People are tolerant, compassionate, they strive to understand each other and build a dialogue, and... just kidding. The above might hold true in general, but not in the magic world of Soka Gakkai, an organization whose aim is global peace, but only if you join them. 

This is one of those rare occasions in which I wished I was blogging in Italian which... why am I not blogging in Italian? It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. In Italian there is a beautiful word: *sedicente*. Depending on the context, in English either by the word *allegedly* or *self proclaimed*. It's a word you don't use or hear every day, but its usage got extremely popular in the Italian news world, especially when talking about ISIS.

> Il sedicente stato islamico (ISIS) è un'organizzazione terroristica jihadista sunnita che si autoproclama califfato e governa su una porzione di territorio tra Iraq e Siria.

I remember when I first heard news like the above ones on the radio and I naively thought that the anchorman was in love with ISIS, all because I confused the words *sedicente* (self proclaimed) and *seducente* (literally, "who likes to seduce"). Since then, I've been in love with this word, and that's why I wish I was blogging in Italian: I could call Soka Gakkai *La sedicente organizzazione mondiale della pace* or *La sedicente organizzazione promotrice del buddismo di Nichiren*. Well, I'm gueess I'm doing it anyway, so... What am I even saying?

There is one episode in particular I would like to talk about today. It happened in November 2024. At the time, Italian members from Soka Gakkai were visiting Japan, and it was a big deal in Soka. Italy is, after all, the European state with the highest number of Soka Gakkai members, and the former president of Soka Daisaku Ikeda loved Italy, and the city of Florence in particular. My wife was thrilled. She asked me to go with her to an welcoming event. I sighed, and thought "How bad can it be?". To make my wife happy I decided to put aside my feelings, make a small sacrifice and go with her. 

The welcome cerimony was a bit cringey for my taste, but at least it was short. I remember chuckling to myself when the Italian members were asked to sing *Nel blu, dipinto di blu* a cappella, and when the music started nobody could remember the exact words. Little did I know, I would not be laughing for very long. After the main event, each Italian member went to talk with some of the local folks, helped by an interpreter, and I was told to go into a room to have a light chat with two members. The conversation started out innocent enough: I told them what I was doing in Japan, my interests... you know, a normal conversation you have with someone you meet for the first time. And then it began.

> Why aren't you a member of Soka Gakkai?

Ah shit, here we go again. I looked around me. I was surrounded by Soka members. There was no interpreter. It was a majestically designed trap. I had no choice but to fight. I tried the diplomatic approach first: I told them I was studying buddhism and everything was still very new to me (true), so I did not want to commit for the moment (also true), but that in the future maybe I could have joined (false). They were not happy with my reply, so they decided to give me a masterclass in *shakubuku*, 折伏, literally "Break and subdue", the Soka Gakkai's favorite method of persuasion, in line with their mission of world peace. After all, how can you achieve world peace if you don't break and subdue people? So they started with all the tricks in the book: They insulted me, they said that my buddhist studies were a joke, they said to me that my wife was unhappy because of me, and many many other cruel things. I could not believe my ears. Was this really happening? They were talking so fast and so loud that they did not even let me reply. When they finally finished and I tried to reply they dismissed me by saying "I'm sorry, we have to go, there is no time".

After all this happened, I felt the need to explain to the people that was there what happened. After all, the conversation was in Italian and there was no interpreter: Everybody could feel the tension, but nobody understood a single word of what had been said. So helped by my wife I wrote a message in Japanese to one of the higher ups in the organization that was present there, explaining what had happened. Guess what? He took their side! Of course he did! He repeated the same insults as the Italian, but in Japanese. Great, I've been dissed in two languages.

You might wonder my wife's role in all of this. I also do. It's still not clear to me.
