Working from home is a nightmare. It is only day 1, and I am already missing all the small routines I had in my office: the coffee break, the whiteboard sessions, the cold beers in the terrace during friday evenings... All seem so distant. It is better to get used to it I guess.

As you have probably learned by now, I absolutely **LOVE QUOTES**! Whether they come from movies, music, literature, videogames, they always give food for thought. Plus, they sound extremely cool if used in the right context. In Italian there is a beatiful word to describe a quote that makes you think: "Aforisma". I learned only today that it has also an English equivalent, aphorism. Better late than never I guess.

My love for "aforismi" started when I was I kid. Since I have memory, I have always been able to remember ALL of my dreams. I thought it was something completely normal, until I started talking about it to other people and realized it was not. So it was really no surprise when, scavenging my grandfather's library for interesting books, my attention was naturally drawn to a big blue book, titled "The wonderful world of dreams". Its cover was also super interesting, featuring a drawing of a smiling half-moon. As I opened it, I saw a paragraph written right in the first page:

*The dream is a little hidden door in the innermost and most secret recesses of the soul, opening into that cosmic night which was psyche long before there was any ego-consciousness, and which will remain psyche no matter how far our ego-consciousness extends.*

Of course the quote was in Italian, there is no way as I kid I could understand this type of English. The book ultimately was a total disappointment: it talked about how to obtain numbers from dreams in order to play to the Italian lottery. In Naples, where I come from, this is a long and known tradition, as testified by the [Smorfia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Smorfia) and [Smorfia Napoletana](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_smorfia_napoletana). Nevertheless, that sentence got stuck into my head. Hell, I still remember it after 20 years!

Use quotes and aphorism in everyday life can be ton of fun and can give you that poser aura you always wanted! Here are some practical examples:

- When someone asks your age answer: ["Old enough to know what dead looks like..."](https://youtu.be/QDJebjf_DkQ?t=842)
- When your are doing something extremely difficult and someone asks you how is it going answer: "Heh, it is [hurting me plenty]({{site.url}}/assets/pictures/doom.png).
- You can write the beginning of [Dante's Inferno III Canto](https://www.thoughtco.com/inferno-canto-iii-divine-comedy-dante-alighieri-4098791) and stick it to the door of your bedroom.

These are just examples. Use your fantasy and you will find way more. I am going to find sooooo many in these long days...
