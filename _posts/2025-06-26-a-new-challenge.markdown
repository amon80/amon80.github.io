As I mentioned brefly in my previous post, recently I've changed my job. Since the new job starts in August, I have a lot of free time. Here are some things that I want to do during this free time:

- Start to study Japanese again. My motivation hit rock bottom in recent times, but it is damn near impossible to live in Japan without speaking Japanese. I can have a basic conversation, book hotels and go to a restaurant, but I can't talk about episodes from the past or complex topics. Reading is completely out of the question of course.

- Start to go to the gym again. After my son was born I did not have a lot of free time, so I stopped going to the gym. It's such a shame, because I lost all the progress I made in the last 2 years, since I started doing calisthenics. Oh well, time to start again from scratch. At least I've been doing a good stretching routine everyday, so at least my flexibility has improved.

- 1 day -> 1 blog post challenge. This idea came to me yesterday night. There's no better way to pick up an old habit: set up a reasonable challenge, not too easy, not toohard and just do it. This is day 1. Until August the 1st there are 36 days. This should result in 36 new blog posts including this one.

I used to get so frustrated in the past when stopping an habit. I used to blame myself for inconsistency and feel extremely low. Buddhism helped me approach life in a different way, a much more compassionate way. But that's the topic for another post.
