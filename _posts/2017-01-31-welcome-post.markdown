It's been since MSN Live Blogs that I hadn't a blog. 

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Hope you guys won't bore too much reading my thoughts!
