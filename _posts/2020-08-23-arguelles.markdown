One of small wonders of life is that sometimes one is attracted by the strangest things, without any reason: you don't know why, you rationally know it does not make any sense, but you can't help it: you just like something so bad that sometimes it just pops in your mind and makes you smile.

This is fascinating by itself, but the best part of this phenomenon in my opinion is that it unconsciously drives our daily life, by affecting our day by day decisions. Often we don't even realise it.

I think my level of expertise on this matter is unmatched. This might sound pretentious, but I can assure you this hasn't been always a good thing for me. In fact, quite the contrary. I have lost the count of times people stared at me with puzzled looks on their faces when I explain my thought process.

I used to be ashamed of this. I used to suppress this part of me. I tried more than once to cancel this completely irrational part of me, to switch off this small voice inside my head that tells me "Come on dude, do it! It will be cool!","Ok, but why?","Just trust me on this", and that's always right. 

Well, this brought me nothing but pain, so I decided to stop. Stop to live someone's else life, and be me. It wasn't an easy decision, and it's still an ongoing proces, but I would retake the same path other 1000 times. Physical sufferings included.

So, here's a list you didn't ask for: Things that I like for no reason.

- The Spanish dieresis. 
- "The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy. 
- The fire, the old lighters, the smell of fuel and setting something on fire. 
- The simmetry. 
- The song "The count of Tuscany" while I'm driving.
- Asian eyes.
- The soviet union anthem. 
- Pompous writing in general.
- ...
