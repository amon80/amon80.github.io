I know the title is confusing. If you have been following this series of blog posts about Soka Gakkai, you might have already realized that nothing is normal when it comes to Soka. It is a strange world dominated by fear, irrationality and evil demons and spirits that might possess you if you don't chant the lotus sutra. The title of this post is normal in comparison.

After somehow I survived the experience with Italian Soka Gakkai members, I was determined to have nothing more to do with Soka. Unfortunately, that is a bit difficult to achieve considering that your wife's family has been in Soka for years and justify everything that they do. When I commented to them my experience with the Italian members, who do you think they supported? A family member or a Soka member? The latter, of course. I'm not even sure that I am considered a family member at this point. Maybe in Soka Gakkai the concept of family differs from the Italian one.

In February 2025, my parents came from Italy to visit me. It was their first time in Japan, so it was a pretty big deal for them. I organized a small tour so that they could enjoy the real Japan, away from the urban chaos of Tokyo. Part of this tour involved sleeping in the buddhist temple of Kuonji in Minobu-san during the cherry blossoms season.

To explain what will happen next, I need to take a little detour in the Buddhist philosophy. It will be a short one, I promise. Soka gakkai claims to be the sole rightful carrier of true buddhism, calling the other buddhist schools inferior (if you are lucky) or slanderous. Soka Gakkai claims also to be the sole rightful heir of Nichiren, a Japanese monk who lived in the 1200s who founded a new school of Buddhism, Nichiren Buddhism. In Nichiren Buddhism, the object of reverence is a scroll written by Nichiren himself with the sentence *Nam-myo-ho-renge-kyo*, or 南無妙法連華経 in Japanese. This scroll is commonly referred to as the *dai-gohonzon* among Soka members, 大御本尊, literally meaning "Great object of reverence". Here's how it looks like:

A [quick search on Google](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=d85e72e6e65eadf5&sxsrf=AE3TifNpySG-TSlotk_T0a-GDB6MLBG7fw:1751155889732&q=dai+gohonzon&udm=2&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeiAkWG4OlBE2zyCTMjPbGmPgfe_7ak8LUsonpWCvT6w6L2Ypi-psgULtjNt7yJHIObNhQRDRM3AnKYf__C8W_NTBo7pV81bpG8zjMZzXkB1rH4Ez6uhOkGEEX8i0CI0S1MhTBOwSgDmuRb5o3HNrstB69902n9_pMDWGyMSF5gJYzt3hfQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjo1oOGrJWOAxUW1TQHHSHmEYIQtKgLKAF6BAgWEAE&biw=1867&bih=964&dpr=1#vhid=b834OqhrJgQYmM&vssid=mosaic) reveal that there are many different styles of gohonzon. Does it matter? In the world of Soka Gakkai, yes, of course it matters. All the gohonzon that are not coming from Soka Gakkai itself are slanderous, and if you use them during your Buddhist practice you will be possessed by an evil spirit. I'm not kidding, that's what they really think. Read until the end for confirmation.

The temple I went to with my parents was a Nichirenshu temple, which is a buddhist school that also follows the teachings of Nichiren. Needless to say, in the eyes of Soka they are the supreme enemy, piling slander on top of slander. Again, I am not exaggerating, you will see at the end.

My parents and I enjoyed our stay in Minobu-san. The monks were super nice to us, drinking tea and having light chat with us. My parents were impressed with the monrning ceremony of sutra chanting, even if they did not really understand what they were saying. A monk who could speak English noticed that and came to us to explain everything about the ceremony, and then asked my mother how similar was that to a Catholic mass, since he had never been to one. Overall, it was a great human experience in a beautiful landscape, to the point my parents said they would like to go back there next time they come to Japan. To support the local community, I donated some money to the temple and purchased two T-shirts with the gohonzon printed on the back, a black one for me and a white one for my wife. 

My wife was very happy about the gift, to the point that she started wearing this t-shirt as a second skin. Unfortunately, one time she wore it in the wrong occasion, while staying at her parents' house. They freaked out, especially her mom, who took a picture of the t-shirt and sent it to the local leader. This caused a lot of drama, and ultimately I decided to give away the t-shirts to two friends of mine to avoid further drama. Here's one of the messages my wife received from the aforementioned leader, translated directly from Japanese:

> So, this is just my opinion, but I don't think it's good to have a print of the honzon on a T-shirt, even if it's from another sect.

> I think Hiromi knows this too, but "Nichiren wrote this by dyeing his soul into ink," and I'm sure that any Nichiren sect that takes this seriously wouldn't know that.

> It is disrespectful to treat the honzon poorly. Of course, the honzons of the Nichiren and Nikken sects are themselves slanderous.

> I don't know where Marco bought it, but that temple? is pretty careless. They are piling slander on top of slander.

> This is why it has a completely different meaning than a goshuin or amulet. Even if we give in and say that it might be good to "cherish the feelings" of the person who gave you the goshuin or amulet, a print of the honzon is definitely not good. It's not a matter of not caring.

> The honzon is the soul and foundation of faith. The fact that you're taking it as a souvenir is a complete evil deed.

> I think it's time for Hiromi to draw the line on how far she will take Marco's escalating feelings. If she doesn't do this properly, she will unknowingly become possessed by evil spirits.

As you can see, I was not exaggerating. Even my wife was scared by this message. But my wife's family it's all on the side of the leader. Of course they are. In the world of Soka, the organization comes first, family later.
