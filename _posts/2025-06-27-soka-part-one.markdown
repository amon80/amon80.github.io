This post is the first one of a series of posts dedicated to my experience with Soka Gakkai. What is Soka Gakkai, you ask? According to their google description they are

> A global community-based Buddhist organization that promotes peace centered on respect for the dignity of life.

Sounds great, right? Well, let me tell you my experience with the organization, then you get to decide whether this definition holds true or not.

I came into contact with Soka Gakkai in 2022 while living in Spain. At the time, I had been going to psychotherapy sessions once a week for about two years to deal with the general feeling of unhappiness that I felt throughout my life. Saying that I was particularly vulnerable at the time is an understatement. Therapy, when done correctly, can be merciless. It forces you to deal with the demons of your past, and sometimes it makes your remember things you wish you forget. It's a necessary price to pay for a greater good: be at peace with yourself, who you are, with all your faults and values.

At first, the organization did not seem too bad. They were holding weekly reunions at some member's place, and it was possible to participate even online. During those meetings, everybody would share their experiences in a roundtable fashion. I did not care too much for the claims that chanting "Nam-myo-ho-renge-kyo" changes one's life, as it looked nothing but embellished Christianism to me, but I did like the degree of openness showcased by the members in talking about their problems. It looked like a group therapy session, and aspect I liked the most was that everybody had a good, positive attitude towards life, despite the many challenging life-changing episodes they had experienced. For a gloomy person like me, participating to Soka Gakkai's reunion was definetely a refreshing experience.

But then, I started to notice some things. Being a curios person, I soon started asking questions:

- What does "Nam-myo-ho-renge-kyo" mean?
- What is the meaning of the two chapters of the lotus sutra that you chant in every reunion?

To these questions I would get very vague answers, which made me realize no one had really any idea about it. This felt so weird. How can you chant for hours something you do not even understand? When I asked this question, I got the stereotypical religious answer: "You need to have faith. Clearly your faith in the lotus sutra is weak". As a very famous gentleman from my generation said: "Ah shit, here we go again". It was at that moment that I understood that I would never be a Soka Gakkai member, as I never liked the idea of blind faith, and Soka Gakkai was built on top of it. Neverthless, going to the reunions was fun, so I kept going, filtering all the religious gibberish and focusing on the actual aspects that could contribute to my growth.

Another unusual behaviour from someone in the organization would show up some months later. I was attending a meeting as usual, and there was a new member. Naturally she got the chance to talk, and she told everybody the story about how she was worried about her son, being freshly graduated from college but unable to find a job. It turned out that her son had graduated from a computer science university, so I decided to step in: Having being in the professional field for almost 5 years at that point, I offered her my number, saying that I could help her son by reviewing his CV, giving him pointers for what to study, organize a portfolio of side projects, etc. After all, that's what you do in an organization that promotes peace, right? You offer your help, without expecting anything in return. She rejoiced at the idea, so we exchanged contact information. After the reunion, one of the old-timers of the group came to talk to me with a very serious face:

- "Marco, you have to be careful."
- "(imagine a puzzled face here) Why?"
- "I know your intentions are good, but please keep in mind that this woman is not in Soka Gakkai. She's not ONE OF US."
- "Well, neither am I. Is that a problem?"

She was shocked by my revelation. She had assumed that I was a member all along. She immediately stopped talking to me with the excuse that someone else was calling for her. I could not help but notice that she kept looking me sideways until I left. Surely enough, some days after I received a message from our group leader saying that in order to be welcome in the reunions one should at least show some degree of wanting to join the organization. I was honest and told her that I had no intention of joining, so she asked me to not show my face around anymore. And that, my friends, was my last interaction with Soka Gakkai in Spain. 

I was hoping to be done with them, but little did I know it was just the beginning of my journey.

Stay tuned for part two, in which we will talk about my experience with Soka Gakkai in Japan.
