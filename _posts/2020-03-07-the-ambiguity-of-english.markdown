"In the next days, something interesting should appear. Stay tuned!"

... And he never updated his blog ever again. Classic.

Luckly, I didn't forget totally about it. I was waiting for the right moment. I just had to wait three crazy years! :)

Last time I wrote here, I was still a student. I was still living with my parents and I had a long term relationship going on. Here is a short summary of what happened since then:

I graduated. I moved to Ireland. I started to work for Intel. I felt sad. I broke up with my girlfriend. I met some of the best people ever. I felt awesome. I started to date a Spanish girl. I started to learn Spanish. I began to travel like there was no tomorrow. I moved too fast too soon. I planned a future with this girl. I realized this girl wasn't for me after the craziest Christmas of my life. I broke up. I moved to Spain. I started to work for Amazon.

Puff, puff... If you have still some air in your lungs after that, kudos to you. I almost died re-reading it. I agree that it is a short summary. I was writing a longer one when I realized that each sentence could be a blog post on its own. I have so much material in my diaries... why was I worrying about not having anything to write? :D

Aaaaanyway, going back to the title of this post. Some days ago I was speaking to a female colleague of mine. Everything pretty normal and casual, until she comes up with the following sentence:

"My partner is having a work interview in Barcelona, so we are going there for the weekend!"

I was going to comment something along the line of "Good! Wish him good luck!". Then I realized something. 

"'Him'? Why not 'Her'? After all, I have no clue, it is the first time she is bringing it up, and the way she has phrased it could apply to both. What do I do now? Should I ask her? Should I act clueless and just go along with my original comment? What is the standard behaviour for this? Is she going to report me to HR? Are we alone in the universe? AAAAAAAAAAAH!"

I was there, speechless, thinking deeply, like the [lady of the famous meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/math-lady-confused-lady). My colleague was looking at me with a puzzled expression. No wonder. She didn't know she broke me like the [flower cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z4jx5VMw8M). 

Finally she asks "... Are you okay?", which brings me back to reality. 
"Ohgodohgodohgod what do I do now?", I think. Then, a flash of brilliance, the solution was under my nose the whole time: Just avoid sexually characterizing pronouns! 
"Sure! I wish your partner all the best for the interview. I'm sure you will have a great time in Barcelona! By the way, have you ever been to..."

Fiuuu... Saved. I am really silly sometimes, I know. Neverthless, I blame English for its ambiguity!
