After writing something as intense and personal as my experience with Soka Gakkai (see [[1]({% post_url 2025-06-27-soka-part-one %})][[2]({% post_url 2025-06-28-soka-part-two %})][[3]({% post_url 2025-06-29-soka-part-three %})][[4]({% post_url 2025-06-30-soka-grand-finale %})]), it is always difficult to write something new. But it's also a refresher, as one gets out of his comfort zone and is forced to come up with other ideas.

Let's talk about Italian music. Saying that the Italian mainstream music is voice-centered would be an understatement: In Italian music the voice is the only thing that matters. Guitar solos? Forget them, it's a miracle if there's even a guitar in the majority of the Italian music proposed by mainstream artists. All instruments that are not the main voice are tuned down, the drums follow some super basic patterns, mostly 4/4, and everything has just one role: Make the voice shine. As a result of this, bands do almost not exist in Italian mainstream music, with singers exchanging band members all the time.

I don't know when this tendency started. Maybe it was always there. Maybe it's the fault of our opera tradition mixed in with pop music. It is said that Italy is *il paese del bel canto* (the country of good singers) after all. I was not able to find a moment in the history of contemporary Italian music in which popular music was something else than what described above. The 60s had Domenico Modugno and his *vooooolare, oh oh*, the greatest one-hit wonder of the history of Italian music. Then we had Mina, one of the greatest voices ever, who realized her voice was the only thing that mattered and so refused to appear in pubblic after 1978. And these two are just the most famous examples, there are many, many more arriving to our days. What does everybody sing about? Love, teenager love, adult love, betrayal love, easy love, difficult love, happy love, sad love. In short: Romantic love. As confirmation of this trend, think about the fact that the Italian music festival, known as Sanremo, you must participate with a love song if you want to win.

Of course, not all Italian music follows the mainstream pattern. There were many, many artists who challanged the status quo and tried to mix things up. Most of them are either forgotten or had to change their style in order to sell some discs. When I was in 20s, I invented a word to distinguish Italian mainstream artists from the rest: *Pausiniani*. This name literally means *Followers of Laura Pausini*, who is the greatest contemporary exponent of the concept: *Ho una gran voce, subitela* (I have a great voice, suffer it). I always had a beef with her, maybe because that fucking *Marco se ne è andato e non ritorna più* ruined my childhood, with every girl and their mother in my town singing it ALL THE TIME.

A little Italian grammar detour. Because of the way Italian works, I will be using the following variations of *pausiniani*:
* *Pausiniano*, singular, male, unspecified.
* *Pausiniana*, singular, female.
* *Pausiniani*, plural, male, unspecified.
* *Pausiniane*, plural, female.

Notable *pausiniani* in activity at the time of writing:

* Laura Pausini. Of course. How could she not be in this list?
* Il volo. Three *pausiniani* in one band. Hurray!
* Elisa, whose intent to imitate Laura Pausini is so, soooo obvious.
* Giuliano Sangiorgi, from Negramaro. I know he's in a group, it doesn't matter. He's the most *pausiniano* in this list probably.
* Emma Marrone, Alessandra Amoroso, and all the talent show winners, mostly females. They make one scary group of *pausiniane*.
* Mina, the *proto-pausiniana*. Yes, she's still active discographically speaking.
* Miscellaneuos: Fiorella Mannoia, Giorgia, Claudio Baglioni, Gianni Morandi. All excellent examples of *pausiniani*.

Some *non-pausiniani* artists worth following:

* Negrita, especially all the albums until *L'uomo sogna di volare* (included).
* Gianluca Grignani, specifically the album *La fabbrica di plastica*.
* Litfiba. The lead singer Piero Pelu went *pausiniano* for a while, but then he returned to his rock origins.
* Vasco Rossi. A weird hybrid between a *pausiniano* and a rockstar.
* Ligabue, all the albums until 2005. Then he went full *pausiniano*.

From now on, you can use my favorite reply if someone asks you if you like artist X: "Nope, he's too *pausiniano*".

Happy listening!
