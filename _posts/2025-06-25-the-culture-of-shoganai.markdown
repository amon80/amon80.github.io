This time, 5 years passed. I'm really terrible at keeping a blog. But for whatever reason I keep coming here. Last time I wrote the world was facing the Covid-19 pandemic. It seems incredible just to think about it.

I moved from Spain to Japan in January 2024, so it's exactly one year and a half that I have been living in Japan at the time of writing. I have discovered some interesting things about Japan, so I decided it was worth to reopen my blog just to share them with the world.

Japan's attitude towards foreigners is interesting, borderline fascinating. One of the first things you noticed after moving to Japan is the fact that they talk about foreigners ALL. THE. TIME. I'm not kidding. There are TV shows about foreigners living in Japan at every other hour. When going out you are guaranteed to listen the word "外国人" ("gaikokujin", the Japanese word for "foreigner") at least three or four times. One might even say Japanese people are obsessed with 外国人. But is it an healthy obsession?

You might have guessed by my word choice, after all there is no such thing as an healthy obsession: No, the relationship Japanese people have with foreigners, what they think about them and how they interact with them is not healthy at all. For this reason, very few outsiders have integrated within the Japanese society, and there is a barrier between foreigners and Japanese people: Separate communities, separate friendships, separate workplaces, separate banks, etc. It is almost like two parallels worlds sharing the same living space.

One big difficulty in the interaction between Japanese people and foreigners is the cultural barrier. This goes way beyond language (which, don't get me wrong, is incredibly difficult). Let me share a personal example.

My first job in Japan was for a Japanese company. I was not happy with the way some things were being handled, so I suggested some possible improvements to the protocols we were following, which were, in my opinion, repetitive and unproductive for no reason at all. The suggestions were pretty much ignored, and that's fine. We don't always get what we want, right? What was surprising for me was discovering by accidents the comments made by some of my co-workers on this episode:

> If Marco doesn't like how things are done he can look for another job.

Ouch, that hurt. Isn't that a bit extreme? For a simple suggestion? Well, not really. I just got served the Japan in Nutshell experience.

It was one of those moments in which I really felt the culture gap between the Japanese and the Western mentalities. It felt so real that I could almost touch it.

In the West, we are taught to question and be critical of the world and people around us. We don’t have an inherent perception that a boss or someone elderly or something is above us. In Japan, it is the complete opposite. Do not question people higher in the hierarchy. Do not be critical of them either. Just do what you are told. It’s a very Asian thing, not even Japanese only. Think of the caste system in India, or the usage of honorific language in Korea/Japan.

So, as a foreigner living in Japan, most of our problems are caused by the fact that we don't like things as they are done here, we complain, we question their reasons and sometimes we try to change them. A Japanese person doesn't do any of that. They simply shrug their shoulders, say 仕様がない ("shoganai", the Japanese way of saying "It cannot be helped") and proceeds to follow the rules. That's the culture of shoganai: Accept things as they are, do not complain. What happens if you complain or you do not accept things as they are and you want to change them? Well, you get labeled as arrogant and selfish. And good luck removing that label after someone gave it to you.

Lesson #1 to survive in Japan as a foreigner: be shoganai with the Japanese and normal with the rest of the world.

Too bad I learned this lesson too late. To close the story, I did eventually have to change job.

I don't remember who told me this, but there is a funny rumor about Japan and foreigners integration. The rumor says that Japan makes life more difficult on purpose for foreigners. They do it to see if you can stand many 仕様がない, like a true Japanese, otherwise... Get the fuck out, we don't need people like you here.
