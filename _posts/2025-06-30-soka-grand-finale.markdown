This post concludes my history with Soka Gakkai. I hope you have enjoyed the emotional rollercoaster until now.

I suspect I will have this issue in my life still for a long time. This people unfortunately seem to not know when to give up. They don't understand that no means no. You have to give them credit for their persistance. 

After the t-shirt drama of the last post, not much happened. Out of stress and hoping to improve my situation, I gave my two t-shirts away as gifts. I thought: "They are just t-shirts, if getting rid of them improves my life, then by all means let's do it". I was wrong, nothing changed. I should have kept the t-shirts.

I'm still banned from my wife's parents place and from family events, indefinitely. I've tried to reach out to my mother in law through LINE, but all I got as reply was the loudest radio silence I have ever heard in my life. She might have even blocked be, who knows at this point. This is where Soka's mentality mixes up with Japanese mentality: Japanese people avoid direct confrontation at all costs. If you try to solve a problem with someone by speaking to them directly, you are just seen as someone who cannot *read the air* ([空気が読めない](https://jisho.org/search/%E7%A9%BA%E6%B0%97%E3%81%8C%E8%AA%AD%E3%82%81%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84)) or someone who disrupts *harmony* ([和](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%92%8C)). Of course, if those evil terrible crimes are done by a Soka member to a non-Soka member to perform our dear old friend *shakubuku* ([折伏](https://jisho.org/word/%E6%8A%98%E4%BC%8F), break and subdue), then it's no problem at all. But don't you dare try to defend yourself, unless you want to be labeled as arrogant indefinitely. 

Here are some advices in how to deal with Soka Gakkai:

- If you are interested in Nichiren Buddhism, search for *Nichirenshu* priests or local groups. They are way more chill than Soka Gakkai, and you will be able to practice Nichiren Buddhism in a normal way, without all the crazy cult stuff.
- When being approached by a Soka Gakkai member, be aware. They might be super nice and friendly at the beginning, but if you say one bad thing about the organization you become their worst enemy in a matter of seconds. Constructive criticism and legitimate doubts are not welcome attitudes in Soka. You must only obey.
- If you are from another buddhist sect and you are in the presence of a Soka Gakkai member, just shut up. They might look nice and open to a constructive dialogue at the beginning, but they are just pretending. Remember that they are taught that all other buddhist interpretations are wrong, and that people who follow them will receive divine punishment and go to hell. In this sense, they remind me of Jehowa's witnesses.
- If you are a Soka Gakkai member and this series of posts has shocked you, do something about it. There are plenty of good people in Soka Gakkai, but the leaders all share the same vision: 
    - *shakubuku* is the way to go. 
    - The more members we have, the better. 
    - Numbers are all that matters. It doesn't matter if people are buddhists or not, as long as they are members.
- Do you really want to be part of an organization that promotes peace and tramples over basic concepts necessary to build peace, such as tolerance and respect?
- If you are a Soka Gakkai member and this series of posts has offended you, I'm sorry for you.
- If a close family member is/becomes a Soka Gakkai member, I'm also sorry for you. But it's a different kind of sorry from the above one. You did not choose to be a part of this madness, yet you are. You have my deepest condolences.

One last fun fact to share: Soka's worst enemies are whistleblowers (内部告発者) . Usually, these are either people who leave the organization, or people like me, who happen to know some bad things about the organization and they are not afraid to share information and experiences on the internet. There is a whole [subreddit founded by them](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/). You might notice that all of people in the subreddit are anonymous. That's because Soka's leaders like to threaten people who might talk about all the sketchy stuff that they do. When all the t-shirt drama was unfolding (pun intended), my mother in law's main concern was me being a whistleblower. It didn't matter that her daughter was crying at night, scared as shit by an organization she did not choose to be in and she's too afraid to leave.
